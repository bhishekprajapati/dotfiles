#: The opacity of the background. A number between zero and one, where
#: one is opaque and zero is fully transparent. This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background, so that things like the status bar in vim, powerline
#: prompts, etc. still look good. But it means that if you use a color
#: theme with a background color in your editor, it will not be
#: rendered as transparent. Instead you should change the default
#: background color in your kitty config and not use a background
#: color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set
#: the terminals default colors in a shell script to launch your
#: editor. See also transparent_background_colors. Be aware that using
#: a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly significant) performance hit.
#: When using a low value for this setting, it is desirable that you
#: set the background color to a color the matches the general color
#: of the desktop background, for best text rendering. Note that to
#: workaround window managers not doing gamma-corrected blending kitty
#: makes background_opacity non-linear which means, especially for
#: light backgrounds you might need to make the value much lower than
#: you expect to get good results, see 6218
#: <https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/6218> for details.

#: If you want to dynamically change transparency of windows, set
#: dynamic_background_opacity to yes (this is off by default as it has
#: a performance cost). Changing this option when reloading the config
#: will only work if dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the
#: original config.

# background_blur 0

#: Set to a positive value to enable background blur (blurring of the
#: visuals behind a transparent window) on platforms that support it.
#: Only takes effect when background_opacity is less than one. On
#: macOS, this will also control the blur radius (amount of blurring).
#: Setting it to too high a value will cause severe performance issues
#: and/or rendering artifacts. Usually, values up to 64 work well.
#: Note that this might cause performance issues, depending on how the
#: platform implements it, so use with care. Currently supported on
#: macOS and KDE.

# transparent_background_colors

#: A space separated list of upto 7 colors, with opacity. When the
#: background color of a cell matches one of these colors, it is
#: rendered semi-transparent using the specified opacity.

#: Useful in more complex UIs like editors where you could want more
#: than a single background color to be rendered as transparent, for
#: instance, for a cursor highlight line background or a highlighted
#: block. Terminal applications can set this color using The kitty
#: color control <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/color-stack/#color-
#: control> escape code.

#: The syntax for specifying colors is: color@opacity, where the
#: @opacity part is optional. When unspecified, the value of
#: background_opacity is used. For example::

#:     transparent_background_colors red@0.5 #00ff00@0.3

# dynamic_background_opacity no

#: Allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either
#: keyboard shortcuts (increase_background_opacity and
#: decrease_background_opacity) or the remote control facility.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

# background_image none

#: Path to a background image. Must be in PNG/JPEG/WEBP/TIFF/GIF/BMP
#: format. Note that when using auto_color_scheme
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/themes/#auto-color-scheme>
#: this option is overridden by the color scheme file and must be set
#: inside it to take effect.

# background_image_layout tiled

#: Whether to tile, scale or clamp the background image. The value can
#: be one of tiled, mirror-tiled, scaled, clamped, centered or
#: cscaled. The scaled and cscaled values scale the image to the
#: window size, with cscaled preserving the image aspect ratio. Note
#: that when using auto_color_scheme
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/themes/#auto-color-scheme>
#: this option is overridden by the color scheme file and must be set
#: inside it to take effect.

# background_image_linear no

#: When background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation
#: should be used. Note that when using auto_color_scheme
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/themes/#auto-color-scheme>
#: this option is overridden by the color scheme file and must be set
#: inside it to take effect.

# background_tint 0.0

#: How much to tint the background image by the background color. This
#: option makes it easier to read the text. Tinting is done using the
#: current background color for each window. This option applies only
#: if background_opacity is set and transparent windows are supported
#: or background_image is set. Note that when using auto_color_scheme
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/themes/#auto-color-scheme>
#: this option is overridden by the color scheme file and must be set
#: inside it to take effect.

# background_tint_gaps 1.0

#: How much to tint the background image at the window gaps by the
#: background color, after applying background_tint. Since this is
#: multiplicative with background_tint, it can be used to lighten the
#: tint over the window gaps for a *separated* look. Note that when
#: using auto_color_scheme
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/themes/#auto-color-scheme>
#: this option is overridden by the color scheme file and must be set
#: inside it to take effect.

# dim_opacity 0.4

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

# selection_foreground #000000
# selection_background #fffacd

#: The foreground and background colors for text selected with the
#: mouse. Setting both of these to none will cause a "reverse video"
#: effect for selections, where the selection will be the cell text
#: color and the text will become the cell background color. Setting
#: only selection_foreground to none will cause the foreground color
#: to be used unchanged. Note that these colors can be overridden by
#: the program running in the terminal.

#: The color table {{{

#: The 256 terminal colors. There are 8 basic colors, each color has a
#: dull and bright version, for the first 16 colors. You can set the
#: remaining 240 colors as color16 to color255.
